# Assignment



## Run
Just run `docker compose up --build`
then browse to http://localhost. You can add images with name and description, click them to open the full size image and remove an images once it is selected.


## Things to do before it will be production ready
(I would have done it if I had more time)
- Add test
- Build FE instead of running it
- Use a production server for BE
- Some styling in the FE
- Close DB connections
- BE error handling, Wrap with a few try except, and send more explaining error messages.
